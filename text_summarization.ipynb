Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it is my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So today, I have come here not only as a Member of Parliament but also as your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, just like you.  \\nIn our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations have led me to believe that the most critical aspect requiring attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. For example, if there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme), then those living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. They should not need to make repeated visits to government offices for this purpose. The government should reach them. Since you have entrusted me with this responsibility, about four crore families have received their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have also encountered cases where some people were left out of government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that programs are reaching everyone as planned—without them having to pay any bribes. We will get the real picture only if we meet the people directly. In this sense, the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and from people across the country whether what I envisioned, and the work I have been doing, aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.  \\nIt is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who used the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person had a severe accident and, after using the card, could afford the necessary operation. Today, he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I have afforded this treatment? But now, with the Ayushman card, I gathered the courage to undergo the operation. Today I am perfectly fine.” Such stories are blessings to me.  \\nThe bureaucrats who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork, and allocate funds also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have received them. Funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies, and they feel truly satisfied. Therefore, the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel proud of their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it has greatly helped her during her time of crisis, they realize they have done a meaningful job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels deeply satisfied.  \\nThere are very few who truly understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people in bureaucratic circles talking about it and expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I have heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, or a sister shared how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her life. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished.

During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "\n",
      "President Kalam is addressing the nation and expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to serve for five years in Rashtrapati Bhavan. He shares his experiences and messages that he has learned during his tenure, which can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development: He highlights the aspirations of the youth and encourages them to work towards making India a developed nation.\n",
      "2. Empower villages: He emphasizes the importance of rural development and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "3. Seed to Food: He stresses the significance of agriculture and the need to ensure food security.\n",
      "4. Defeat problems and succeed: He encourages people to overcome challenges and achieve success.\n",
      "5. Overcome problems through partnership: He emphasizes the importance of collaboration and partnership to overcome problems.\n",
      "6. Courage in combating calamities: He highlights the need for courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and other challenges.\n",

      "9. Youth movement for Developed India 2020: He encourages the youth to work towards making India a developed nation by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. He assures her that it is a thoughtful question and encourages her to work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, calling it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, implying that it would be given serious consideration and attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. The speaker, likely the President of India, shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland and seeing the positive impact of empowered village councils. They emphasize the need to provide physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex in 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative provides three types of connectivity: physical, electronic, and knowledge, leading to economic connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker notes that this has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, with active support from the government. The overall message is that empowering villages and providing connectivity can lead to transformation and competitiveness, and should be a guiding factor in national development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of a project in Periyar PURA villages, where 1000 self-help groups have been actively supported to generate employment and create entrepreneurs. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivating Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, power generation using biomass, food processing, and running marketing centers. The project has also led to the development of 55 lifestyle products with international competitiveness, thanks to the support of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO).\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes that this type of project can be replicated across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, and that 7000 such PURA projects would be needed to achieve this goal. The project has also enhanced the innovative ability of the people in the villages, enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. First, they mention meeting over 6,000 farmers from across India at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of agriculture and the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources, improve economic conditions, and empower farmers to protect the land. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was smiling and radiant, and expressed gratitude to God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence and help. When asked what the speaker could do for him, he requested to sing in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The speaker shares a personal experience with a physically challenged individual who, despite his disability, has a remarkable talent for music. The individual's positive attitude, perseverance, and encouragement from his parents, teachers, and others have allowed him to blossom and share his art with others.\n",
      "2. The speaker recounts a visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake. Despite the severe damage and losses, the villagers showed remarkable resilience and courage in overcoming their problems. The speaker praises the villagers for not allowing their problems to become their master, but instead, they have become the masters of their own fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message of the speech is one of inspiration and hope, highlighting the importance of positive attitude, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges and disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the author's observations and experiences with courage in the face of calamities. The author shares a recent experience of visiting a village affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief efforts and rebuilding their community. The author also shares a previous experience visiting a village in the Car Nicobar Islands, where they witnessed the unique trait of the islanders, who had taken in the victims of the 2004 tsunami as their own children, showing remarkable courage and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author also mentions a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which celebrates the courage and determination of the islanders. The poem is about facing the challenges of the sea and overcoming them with God's grace. The author concludes by highlighting the importance of connectivity for societal transformation, referencing a speech they gave at the Pan African Parliament in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a Pan African e-Network, a project to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections, estimated to cost $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa), 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, where Indian specialists from CARE Hospital are providing medical services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the following points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Indian collaboration with Africa: The speaker mentions that Hyderabad's Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa has been providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors since November 2006, using a Pan-African network. The speaker expresses happiness that Indian technology has enabled this collaboration, bringing societal transformation to the African continent.\n",
      "2. Defence of the nation: The speaker shares personal experiences visiting the Indian Army's KUMAR base in Siachen Glacier, the submarine INS Sindhurakshak, and the Sukhoi-30 fighter jet. The speaker expresses pride in the bravery and dedication of Indian Defence Forces, who work tirelessly to protect the nation, even in challenging conditions.\n",
      "3. Para-military forces and police: The speaker acknowledges the significant contributions made by para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "4. Youth movement for Developed India 2020: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming youth into enlightened citizens, with the motto \"Lead India 2020\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh to become enlightened citizens. The foundation, led by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, is partnered with the district administration and has already shown significant impact in the Medak district, with students exhibiting self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of responsibility towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who was able to influence her father to quit smoking after attending a Lead India training camp. The speaker believes that empowering the country's 540 million youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial, and that the Lead India program is a positive step towards achieving this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural and civilizational heritage, while also pursuing economic growth. They express confidence in the country's progress over the past 60 years and highlight the potential of the country's 540 million youth. The speaker quotes a famous poem, \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", and encourages the youth to aim high, as their dreams will come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five key aspects of the distinctive profile of a developed India by 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmonious integration of agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with values for all meritorious candidates, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. India as a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a sense of optimism and a call to action for the citizens to work towards realizing these goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a ideal nation that is:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A place where everyone has access to excellent healthcare\n",
      "* Governed in a responsible, transparent, and corruption-free manner\n",
      "* Free from poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy society with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, expresses his gratitude to the citizens for their love and support over the past five years. He shares his mission to bridge the gap between the hearts and minds of Indians, instilling self-confidence and a sense of \"we can do it\" in the country. He aims to make India a developed nation by 2020 and invites the citizens to join him in this mission. He concludes by wishing God's blessings on the nation and ends with the slogan \"Jai Hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
